Hibari Hanakokanae from Cyber Team in Akihabara
-----------------------------------------------
	- "Cyber team in Akihabara" is a japanese anime, 
	  I watch this program from my cable TV.
	  Hibari is a high school girl, she is 139cm tall,
	  but in my 3d model she is about 60 inches.

	  create model?". If you really want to know check these

	- I've a HLMDL homepage too but I won't tell you 'cause It 
	  contains many models with such a huge number of tris.
	  What a shame!

Release: 1.03, 02-28-00
New in 1.03
	- Cut down about 150 faces, but her appearance changed
	  very slightly. Mainly, I collapsed many vertices in her
	  hair.
	- After I had read many reviews made by COLD FUSION guys,
	  I repainted my skin with higher contrast and space usage.
	- Readjusted her head hitbox, smaller to fit her face.
	- Removed some animation glitches.
	- Recreated crawl animation.
	- Add some unused deathmatch animations (e.g. aim_2, 
	  shoot_1. I don't know whether they're for new/unknown 
	  weapons in other mods -- I neither downloaded 
	  any new mods to test nor had OP4/CSTRIKE. [but why should
	  I try it on TFC? I've just realized when writing this.])
	
!:
	- DO NOT SELL THIS #$&) FOR $$$.
	- NO PAYMENT IS MADE IF THIS MODEL INFLICT ANY DAMAGE
	  ON YOUR COMPUTER, YOURSELF OR WHATEVER RELATED.

Model Advantage/Disadventage:
	- Small sized model.
	- Big head (so does its hitbox), being shot easily!
	- Vivid color, easily spotted.
	
Mesh Resolution: 
	Version		Faces	Vertrices
	 Current (1.03)	864  	456
	 1.00 		999  	540
	 0.95   	1100	586

	- Firstly, it was 1100 gons but after I read about
	  the COLD FUSION submission rule, I tried very hard
	  to keep them lower. And I stopped at 999 because it's
	  a cool number (In fact, I can't find any more faces to
	  delete :)
	- Eventually, I ripped them off another 145 faces.

Skin:
	- One 256x256 bitmap.
	- Team colors can't be changed...

Animations:
	- Altered Biped plus new bones.
	- Mainly, animations are altered from valve's.
	- NEW:
	   ... 2 deadposes
	   ... duck and crawl animations
	   ... glock animations

Comments:
	- It's the first time that I could create a model that so
	  low in faces. Many people may tell me it's not a small
	  number. Actually, over 20s models that I have created
	  are over 1200 faces (The most that I have created is 3580
	  tris + a 512x512 skin and it's half-life model!!! -- not
	  a model for CG movies or other purposes). Because I think 
	  the beauty of models is the first priority. Later I know
	  that lots of faces show how much I suck.
	- The model have some non-depth faces. In both animations
	  and normal pose, you may notice some glitches at her 
	  skirt or her shirt. Some were removed when altering valve
	  's animations, others still inevitably not.
	- Hibari's legs don't deform very well in some animations. 
	  Because many faces spend on her suit and hair, so there
	  are not much quota left for the legs...
	- To be honest, I don't dare to create a skin that team
	  colors can be changed. It may reduce my skin quality
	  if I repaint some parts of it in limited colors.
	- Hope you guys enjoy this model!!
