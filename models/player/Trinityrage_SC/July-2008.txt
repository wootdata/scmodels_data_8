July, 2008:

-Added custom Matrix-like animations that were with the DM version of this model.
-Adjusted skin to compensate for "UV-shift."

That is all

This particular model has been around a LONG time - HL Deathmatch, as well as Sven Coop. Therefore, I see no reason to take credit for something as simple as adding animations. 


Jan, 2009:

Unfortunately, SC 4.0b isn't always compatible with all custom animations - this version has standard SC 4.0b animations.
