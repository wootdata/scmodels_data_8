Version 			: 2

What has been done	: 
Improved Hit Boxes 	- no longer misaligned with the meshes 
UV Chopped Textures - I used a technique I call UV Chopping, to split the UV maps and to separate the large 1024x1024 and 2048x2048 textures into 512x512 textures, thus retaining the original source quality of the textures. 
Baked Normal Maps 	- I used a technique for backing the normal maps into the defuse maps, thus achieving pseudo normal map effect in Half-Life 1 engine
Improved Animations - handpicked the animations for better alignment with the game / mod needs
HQ Overview image 	- I created a stylized  model preview image for easy identification of the models in-game. The theme for the preview is based on FBI / Police case files.
