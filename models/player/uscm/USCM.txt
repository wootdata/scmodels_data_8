Description:
This USCM model was made for the x TC names USCM:Infestation, which was foxed.  The Skin is based on pics of Hudsons uniform from the movie Aliens (Thanks to Harry Harris).  The model and skin where sitting on my HD for a while so I decided to make it into a Hlf-Life DM player.

Put all files into valve/models/player/USCM

Distribution:
The USCM model can be distributed freely as long as this text file is included.
