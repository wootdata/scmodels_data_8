	-run2/run: I redid the run animation to create more "sway" in the upper body.
	-longjump: Replaced the standard LJ animation with a forward flip.
	-ref_aim & ref_shoot_shotgun: I added a "pump" motion to the end of the anim, as well as trying to improve on the grip.  Dieter holds the shotty a bit to the side in the idle position.
	-ref_aim & ref_shoot_akimbo(_sl included): I think it looks a little weird to continually run with arms outstretched ready to fire, I made the aim animation very different and extended the fire anim to last a lot longer.  This way, short pauses between shots don't revert to the "aim" position.
	-ref_aim & ref_shoot_onehanded/44/sl: Nothing too fancy, it has a nice kick to it. :)

Dieter is a 'ronin'.  A disavowed spy, this German/Swiss gunfighter floats from country to country, one step ahead of the myriad of mobsters, triads, and international agencies he has crossed.  He has no morals when it comes to contracts and no allegiances once that contract has been fulfilled.  He could pop up anywhere, his twin automatics smoking like the cigarette he seems to eternally have in his mouth.
