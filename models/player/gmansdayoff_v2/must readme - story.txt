Base Model: GMAN

Model Name: Gmans Day Off  (GmansDayOff)

Description: Gman dressing and acting his way.. after a hard stressful 
day at the Black Mesa Lab. (Not satanist, I hate those people.)

Designer: Sc0rpion (darkscorpion@prodigy.net) **My first model**



Overall:  Gman is a highly mysterious character (As you can see, he has a thing for Scorpions) whom in the Single Player game of Half-Life is made of metal. (To bad that doesn't fall under the multiplayer game.) I haven't seen a Gman model out there that has been modified (I'm sure there are plenty though). So I guess I took it upon myself one night to develop this very stressed, shotgun pumper to demolish anything in its path.  I guess when you work at Black Mesa for so long (even when you got headcrabs up your ass) this is your way of relaxing your stressed up muscules. At least that's what Gman does.

I guess you could call him.. Ghetto G?  Doesn't really look like a thug... does he?  E-mail me your opinion!

Directions: If your new to Half-Life or multiplayer or your just plain
stupid these are the directions for using GmansDayOff.
Copy all contents of the folder and put it in
C:\<yourhalflife directory>\valve\models\player\GmansDayOff

Future: I plan to make many more skinz for HL including multiplayer
and single player maps.  If you like Gmans Day Off or if you
think it sucks, drop me some flames at darkscorpion@prodigy.net.


Since I've really gotten into Half-Life a whole lot, I'm thinking about
developing a website on behalf of my work (models, maps, skins)
and other people's work to give awards and let people get recongnized.

I'm thinking about starting a clan entitled, GDO, and of course
it's  Gmans Day Off.  So if you interested in helping me design my 
upcoming site or are interested in GDO, my ICQ is 35731476.

There's nothing like coming home from work.  Gman just goes overboard.
