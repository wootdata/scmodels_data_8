This is (as you may all know her) Nuku nuku, Got a couple of questions as too
why she's in this virtualy unknown outfit :)  Well this was the easiest one 
that I found when digging on the web for reference shots, but worry not!

I do plan on making a version of her, in her more known dress with the extended
ears.

(And for those of you wondering the '-b' is for battle suit ;)

Custom Animations...

Well -techincaly- everything, the skeleton is off of Onna! 
I didn't realy include any custom ones, these are just the converted ones
too fit the new biped. I may put out some more effort in the animations in 
th next revision of her...
